The Process that pentesters follow is summarized in the following steps:
  Reconnaissance
  Enumeration/Scanning
  Gaining Access
  Privilege Escalation
  Covering Tracks
  Reporting

# Enumeration/Scanning phase, the attacker is interacting with the target to determine its overall attack surface.
The attack surface determines what the target might be vulnerable to in the Exploitation phase.

Privilege escalation can take many, many forms, some examples are:
    Cracking password hashes found on the target
    Finding a vulnerable service or version of a service which will allow you to escalate privilege THROUGH the service
    Password spraying of previously discovered credentials (password re-use)
    Using default credentials
    Finding secret keys or SSH keys stored on a device which will allow pivoting to another machine
    Running scripts or commands to enumerate system settings like 'ifconfig' to find network settings, or the command 'find / -perm
    -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null' to see if the user has access to any commands they can run as root


Since the rules of engagement for a penetration test should be agreed to before the test occurs, the penetration tester should stop IMMEDIATELY when they have achieved privilege escalation and report the finding to the client. 
While ethical hackers rarely have a need to cover their tracks, you still must carefully track and notate all of the tasks that you performed as part of the penetration test to assist in fixing the vulnerabilities and recommending changes to the system owner.
